            <title>An interactive introduction to computational neuroscience</title>
            <link>http://sje30.github.io/post/neuro-binder/</link>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;For a few years I&amp;rsquo;ve given a workshop, a two hour introduction to
computational neuroscience, for masters students.  This has covered
the Hodgkin-Huxley model of action potential generation, reduced
models, and simple small-networks.  Most of the content was previously
matlab code, provided by other researchers, most notably &lt;a href=&#34;http://cvr.yorku.ca/webpages/wilson.htm&#34;&gt;Hugh
Wilson&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.izhikevich.org/&#34;&gt;Eugene
Izhikevich&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the last few months, we (mostly Derek Fulton and Paraskevi
Mylona) have converted this matlab code to the
&lt;a href=&#34;http://julialang.org&#34;&gt;Julia&lt;/a&gt; programming language.  This was partly
to evaluate Julia as a replacement for matlab (and the signs so far
are very encouraging) and also to evaluate recent cloud-based
infrastructure for running notebooks.  At the eleventh hour before
this year&amp;rsquo;s workshop I decided to switch to Julia for running the
workshop.  Thankfully, on the day all the technology worked perfectly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To try the workshop for yourself, simply visit the following link:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/sje30/julia-python/master?filepath=Introduction%20to%20Computational%20Neuroscience.ipynb&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://mybinder.org/badge.svg&#34; alt=&#34;Binder&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This should launch an interactive Jupyter notebook, where all the
graphs can be dynamically regenerated.  To try this, first go to the
&lt;em&gt;Cell menu -&amp;gt; All Output -&amp;gt; Clear&lt;/em&gt; to clear al the items and then
&lt;em&gt;Cell -&amp;gt; Run All&lt;/em&gt; to re-generate them.  (The first time you regenrate,
it may take a while as it needs to load various packages.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think this technology is a great way of providing resources.
Students do not need to load any software onto their local machine;
all you need is a modern web browser and an internet connection.  No
more matlab licenses required! It also introduces students to the
notion of reproducible documents: live figures that can be
regenerated, rather than static figures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tutorial is a bit rough around the edges, and not really
appropriate for independent study, but I intend to develop more
resources in this direction, and feedback welcome!&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Towards standard practice for sharing of code and data in neuroscience</title>
            <link>http://sje30.github.io/post/code-sharing/</link>

            <description>

&lt;p&gt;Scientists are increasingly dependent on computational techniques to
analyse large volumes of data.  These computational methods are often
tailored to the particular analysis in mind, and as such are valuable
research outputs.  Furthermore, unlike experimental techniques,
computational methods can be easily shared.  However, at least in
neuroscience, computational methods are not routinely shared upon
publication of associated manuscripts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To improve this situation, we have worked with the editors of &lt;em&gt;Nature
Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt; to establish a pilot &lt;em&gt;code review&lt;/em&gt; project.  Once papers
have been  approved in principle for publication, authors can opt-in to
the code review.  The code (and data) will be checked to see if
independent reviewers can reproduce key findings of the paper.  The
details of the code review process are outlined in the
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nature.com/neuro/journal/v20/n6/full/nn.4579.html&#34;&gt;editorial&lt;/a&gt;, and we have written a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nature.com/neuro/journal/v20/n6/full/nn.4550.html&#34;&gt;commentary&lt;/a&gt; to describe
good practice for sharing of code and data.  For example, we suggest
the minimum requirement for sharing is that sufficient code and data
be provided to regenerate a key figure/table of the paper.  This
follows the well-established requirements for submitting code to
&lt;a href=&#34;http://modeldb.yale.edu&#34;&gt;modeldb&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although our current guidelines are focused around code and data in
Neuroscience, most of our suggestions apply across many scientific
disciplines.  Just as journals (and funders) now require the sharing
of data underlying a research paper, we believe the underlying code
should also be freely shared.  We hope that other journals
will adapt appropriate policies to allow for the long-term sharing and
reuse of scientific code.  By sharing the code and data relating to
research articles, communities will be able to reproduce and extend
upon each other&amp;rsquo;s work.  This should lead to more robust scientific
results and reduce duplication of effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This project emerged from discussions at a workshop to encourage
sharing in neuroscience, held in Cambridge, December 2014.  It was
financially supported and organized by the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.incf.org&#34;&gt;International
Neuroinformatics Coordinating Facility&lt;/a&gt;,
with additional support from the
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.software.ac.uk&#34;&gt;Software Sustainability Institute&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
